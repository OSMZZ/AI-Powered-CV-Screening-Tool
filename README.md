# AI-Powered CV Screening Tool

## Description
This project is focused on developing an intelligent CV screening tool that leverages AI to simplify and enhance the recruitment process. The tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and summarize key information from CVs, such as:

- Work experience
- Education
- Skills
- Contact information

## Features
- **Automated CV Parsing:** Extract relevant details from uploaded CVs.  
- **Intelligent Summarization:** Highlight the most important information tailored to predefined criteria.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Upload CVs easily and view organized results in an intuitive dashboard.  
- **Data Anonymization:** Ensure privacy and compliance with confidentiality standards.  

## Objectives
1. Build a dataset of CVs for training and testing models.
2. Experiment with NLP and LLM models to achieve accurate information extraction.
3. Develop a user interface for seamless CV import and result visualization.
4. Validate the tool with end-users (e.g., HR professionals) to ensure practical utility.

This project is designed to assist recruiters by automating the candidate screening process, saving time, and improving decision-making efficiency.
