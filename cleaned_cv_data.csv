"""Director of Business Development 04/2005 to 04/2015 Company Name City , State Washington, DC I was called upon to develop and implement growth initiatives in the most difficult scenarios. Whether in low market share environments or during construction recessions or a combination of both, I significantly increased market share in any city to which I was assigned. Through my leadership and supervision, I expanded our market share in Miami, Knoxville, Minneapolis, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Tulsa, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Orlando, Denver, Tucson, Houston, New Orleans, Biloxi, New York City, Indianapolis, Birmingham, Nashville, Chattanooga, Sacramento, Modesto, and Fresno. Following is a partial list of noteworthy accomplishments from those assignments: Miami - I developed relationships with building owners in downtown Miami and leveraged those relationships into a group meeting of 17 building owners representing 38 buildings. I delivered a PowerPoint presentation which led to the owners to insist that their building managers give us priority budding status on every project. This one action resulted in substantial growth for my organization. Minneapolis - Redesigned the business development program to focus on building relationships with end-users. As a result, the end-users would insist on using us on their projects. Using this approach, I was able to build enough relationships in the construction industry to experience significant growth, even during a downturn in the construction market. Austin - I took over the business development program of a unit which had steadily declined its market share. After investigating untapped opportunities, I launched an initiative to pursue a new market. The careful execution of my plan resulted in more than a doubling of business in under 12 months. The relationships built with general contractors and end-users led to expanding our market share into San Antonio, Waco, and Dallas. Denver - When I arrived in Denver, out of a list of 200 clients, only 8 were attending monthly informational and sales meetings. I repositioned the agenda away from a """"pitchy"," preachy"""" sales presentation to an informational", educational, and interactive format. Within three months, attendance at those meetings grew from 8 to over 90 attendees.

Throughout the transition from poor performance to exceptional performance, I accomplished the following: 1) Immediately cut manning in the Steel Module department from 167 down to 127, with immediate improvement in cost performance and no degradation in schedule. 2) Continued to reduce manning through attrition and the elimination of contract employees to achieve on budget cost performance. 3) Once stabilized, schedule performance began to improve until the group was back on baseline schedule and improvements began to happen daily. 4) Built a solid Team that has continued to improve and is currently operating with 70 employees as opposed 167 and continues to gain schedule and make improvements.
